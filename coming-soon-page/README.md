## Email Validation

The email validation is powered by a simple JavaScript function:
- Ensures the email address matches the standard format.
- Displays an error message if the input is invalid.
- Shows a success alert for valid inputs.

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints:
- **1200px and above:** Desktop layout with a split design (image and details side by side).
- **991px to 768px:** Adjusted padding for a more compact design.
- **768px and below:** Stacked layout with the image at the top and details below.
- **375px and below:** Fully optimized for small screens with reduced font sizes and input widths.

## Challenges

- **Image Cropping:** Ensured the hero image adapts to the container while maintaining focus on the top part of the image.
- **Form Validation:** Integrated an intuitive user experience for email validation.

## Future Improvements

- Add backend integration to store submitted emails.
- Implement animations for smoother interactivity.
- Improve accessibility for screen readers.
